# Event-Driven Highly Scalable Fault-tolerant Distributed Websocket/REST Everything API

## Introduction
This project is a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed, event-driven, and everything API. It is designed to be a one-stop solution for all your API needs. It is designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant. It is designed to be everything. It is designed to be an optimal API.

It's still a work in progress though. It's not ready for production yet. But it's getting there.

## Features
- Multi-protocol support (Websocket, REST)
- Event-driven (via RabbitMQ)
- Fault-tolerant (doesn't crash on errors)
- Authentication (JWT)

## Architecture
This project uses the **BEST DATABASE EVER** (MongoDB), to handle all your database needs!

To handle complex and long-running tasks we have designed a **SUPERIOR TASK QUEUE** running on top of RabbitMQ.

For development, we use **Docker** to make sure that everything works on your machine & we have chosen MailHog so we don't accidentally send emails to real people.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Fill in the `.env` file
4. Profit?

## Contributing
We are open to contributions. Just open a PR and we will review it.

Make sure that your code is **PERFECT** and **OPTIMAL**. We don't accept anything less.

If it doesn't meet our standards, we will break down and cry. We don't want that, do we?
